		<h4><p>My name is Paul and I'm currently 14 years old. I moved to NY from Pennsylvania. I spend most of free time playing League of Legends. My primary lane is mid lane and I main Zed, Akali and Riven. Its a really interesting game and I've been playing since about July of 2017. I started to get a lot better over the course of quite a few months then I took a break for a few months. As of now, I'm still unranked because I only have about 48 champions and I need about 10 more before I start my Season 8 Placements. I consistently get Master and Diamond rated games and I'm hoping to get to Master by the end of the year. The main people I look up to are NF, Russ and Witt Lowry. I'd say I have a pretty interesting and diverse taste in music. I like NF, Witt Lowry, Eminem, G-Eazy, Russ, Charile Puth, Justin Timberlake as well as many others.</p></h4>
